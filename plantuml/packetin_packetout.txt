title BFT-SDN: Packet Processing (Packet-In to Packet-Out)

actor UserDevice
participant Switch as SW
participant "POX Primary\n(PoxPbftApp)" as POX_P
participant "PBFT Dealer" as DEALER
collections "PBFT Nodes (N)" as PBFT_NODES
participant "POX Replica X\n(DeterministicLogic)" as POX_R_X
participant "POX Replica Y\n(DeterministicLogic)" as POX_R_Y


group Packet Arrival and Initial Processing by Primary
    UserDevice -> SW: Sends Data Packet
    SW -> POX_P: OFPT_PACKET_IN (No matching flow)
    POX_P -> POX_P: Computes ProposedAction (using its DeterministicL2SwitchLogic)
    POX_P -> DEALER: gRPC: RequestConsensus(PacketInfo, ProposedAction)
end

group Dealer Initiates PBFT for SDN Action
    DEALER -> DEALER: Creates SdnControlInput PBFT Tx
    DEALER -> PBFT_NODES: Broadcasts SdnControlInput Transaction (via sender)
    loop for each PBFT Node
        PBFT_NODES -> PBFT_NODES: Receives Tx, adds to Pool
    end
end

group PBFT Consensus on SDN Action (Validation against Replicas)
    PBFT_NODES -> PBFT_NODES: Proposer includes SdnControlInput Tx in Block
    PBFT_NODES -> PBFT_NODES: Broadcasts Pre-Prepare(Block)

    loop for each PBFT Node (e.g., Node X) receiving Pre-Prepare
        PBFT_NODES -> POX_R_X: gRPC: CalculateAction(PacketInfo from Tx)
        note right of PBFT_NODES : (Node X queries its Replica X)
        POX_R_X -> POX_R_X: Computes Action (using its DeterministicL2SwitchLogic)
        POX_R_X --> PBFT_NODES: gRPC: CalculateActionResponse(ComputedAction)
        PBFT_NODES -> PBFT_NODES: Compares ProposedAction (from Tx) with ComputedAction (from Replica)
        note right of PBFT_NODES: (Currently logs warning on mismatch)
    end
    note over PBFT_NODES: (Similar validation happens at other nodes with their replicas)

    PBFT_NODES <-> PBFT_NODES: PBFT Consensus Continues (Prepare, Commit phases)
end

group Block Commit and Result Notification to Dealer
    loop for each PBFT Node that commits the block
        PBFT_NODES -> PBFT_NODES: Extracts SdnControlInput from committed block
        PBFT_NODES -> DEALER: TCP: ConsensusResultMess(TxHash, FinalAction=ProposedAction, Success=true)
        note right of PBFT_NODES: (Node sends result via its direct TCP conn to Dealer's IncomePort)
    end
end

group Dealer Responds to Primary, Primary Executes Action
    DEALER -> DEALER: Matches ConsensusResult to pending gRPC request
    DEALER --> POX_P: gRPC: ConsensusResponse(FinalAction, ConsensusReached=true)
    POX_P -> POX_P: Receives response
    POX_P -> SW: OFPT_PACKET_OUT (based on FinalAction)
    SW -> UserDevice: Forwards/Floods Packet (or another destination)
end
